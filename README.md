## About the project

There is a lack of proper guidance among new learners regarding what to do, where to learn, how to achieve which can be solved if experienced people come together on a platform and guide them through their experience.
To bridge this gap between learners and experienced professionals(mentors). we are creating a platform called “Get A Mentor.”

**Problem statement**

21sth century is the century of skills.There is so much to learn, explore and expertise.So how can a beginner decide where to start,and what all things to learn which are relevant in a specific field.When a student starts learning from themselves,they lack the motivation to complete their respective courses/guide etc because they do not have anyone to hold them accountable, and inspire them. Often times,when a student hits an obstacle,such as doubts etc,students often quits. To tackle all these problems and provide an end to end solution, we are creating this platform.

**Proposed solution**

1. A platform where new learners can connect to professionals in their respective fields.
2. This will be a platform with the following features -
   - finding the right mentor-mentee pair.
   - A list of highly experienced and qualified mentors to choose from.
   - collecting honest feedback from mentees.
   - managing participants' expectations.
   - mentoring challenges also include tracking the program's outcome
   - Live sessions with mentors,Q&A sessions, a place to submit your work(assignment etc)
   - Students will get easy access to the resources and experience from the mentors.
   - Mentors who want to part their knowledge to the next generation can easily do so without affecting their daily professional life. This will specially help those professionals who are well aware of the industry and want to contribute and pay back.
